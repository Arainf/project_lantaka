Styling
The app is styled using Tailwind CSS. All styles are located within the src/styles directory. For customization, you can modify the tailwind.config.js file.

ShadCN UI components are used to maintain a cohesive and modern UI. For component usage and customization, refer to the ShadCN documentation.
